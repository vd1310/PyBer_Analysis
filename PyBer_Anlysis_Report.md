# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze the city and ride data for 'Pyber'and create necessary dataframes and charts to help decision makers to undersatnd data differences between various cities
### Purpose
###### Use Python and Pandas to create summary DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type
###### Use Matplotlib to create multiple-line graph to show total weekly fares by each city type
###### Summarize differnces by city type

## Results: 

#### 1. Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types
##### a. Urban city type has the highest number of drivers and ride and Rural city type showed least driver count and rides
##### b. Higher number of rides in Urban city type also generated highest fares (39854.38) whereas Rural city type resulted in least fare (4327.93)
##### c. The above trends resulted in the average fare per ride in Rural bieng highest (34.62) vs Urban bieng lowest (24.52)

#### 2. Multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
###### a. All the city types showed a spike in third week of Feb followed by sharp dip in fares in the last week of Feb
###### b. Urban city type showed a steady increase in fares up until third week of Feb followed by a dip in last week of Feb. Urban city fares were erratic in the month of March by showing ups and downs in fares and then started a downward trend in April
###### b. Sub Urban city type also showed a steady increase in fares up until third week of Feb followed by a dip in last week of Feb. Sub urban city fares were stable in the month of March and started rising in April
###### b. Rural city fares were reported lowest but showed a steady trend through Jan - April period with exceptions bieng sudden drop in forth week of Feb and 1st week of Apr

#### 3. How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
The scores of Thomas High School dropped marginally. Overall passing also reduced from 90.9 to 90.6. The below comparison shows the drop in the scores:
