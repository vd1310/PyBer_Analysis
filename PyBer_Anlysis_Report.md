# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze the city and ride data for 'Pyber'and create necessary dataframes and charts to help decision makers to undersatnd data differences between various cities
### Purpose
###### Use Python and Pandas to create summary DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type
###### Use Matplotlib to create multiple-line graph to show total weekly fares by each city type
###### Summarize differnces by city type

## Results: 

#### 1. Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types
##### a. Urban city type has the highest number of drivers and ride and Rural city type showed least driver count and rides
##### b. Higher number of rides in Urban city type also generated highest fares (39854.38) whereas Rural city type resulted in least fare (4327.93)
##### c. The above trends resulted in the average fare per ride in Rural bieng highest (34.62) vs Urban bieng lowest (24.52)

#### 2. How is the school summary affected? 
###### As we can see only Thomas High School are impacted and reduced, refer to below images for comparison results:

#### 3. How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
The scores of Thomas High School dropped marginally. Overall passing also reduced from 90.9 to 90.6. The below comparison shows the drop in the scores:

#### 4. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

###### a. Math and reading scores by grade
The scroes are almost the same with slight drop in Thomas High School only:
